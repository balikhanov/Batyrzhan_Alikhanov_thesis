abstract = {This article describes a new algorithm for the detection and delineation of tree crowns using optical sub-meter resolution satellite images. The algorithm focuses on detecting individual semi-isolated trees in a variety of environments defined as trees outside forests (TOF). The concept of Marked Point Processes (MPPs), which alternates phases of “birth” and “death” iterations to satisfy a density factor was used as a theoretical basis. The “mark” in the MPP represents the object being sought. Unlike most applications of MPP to object recognition, the mark used in our algorithm is computed from a 3D geometrical optical model artificially lit using the same illumination parameters as the image itself. Because trees differ in size, the process also incorporates a tree crown radius variable. The algorithm is tested on four sub-meter satellite images, each in a different environment. Validation was performed on both detection and delineation. The detection was based on tree crown counting and yielded an accuracy ranging from 0.81 to 0.95 for the four images. The delineation accuracy was estimated based on the crown pixel count and yielded an accuracy of ≈ 0.63 (0.57–0.72).},

abstract = {Detection and classification of tree species from remote sensing data were performed using mainly multispectral and hyperspectral images and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data. Despite the comparatively lower cost and higher spatial resolution, few studies focused on images captured by Red-Green-Blue (RGB) sensors. Besides, the recent years have witnessed an impressive progress of deep learning methods for object detection. Motivated by this scenario, we proposed and evaluated the usage of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) high spatial resolution RGB imagery for the detection of law protected tree species. Three state-of-the-art object detection methods were evaluated: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), YOLOv3 and RetinaNet. A dataset was built to assess the selected methods, comprising 392 RBG images captured from August 2018 to February 2019, over a forested urban area in midwest Brazil. The target object is an important tree species threatened by extinction known as Dipteryx alata Vogel (Fabaceae). The experimental analysis delivered average precision around 92{\%} with an associated processing times below 30 miliseconds.},

This study proposes and compares three different approaches for automatic detection and counting of trees in different vegetative regions. First approach is to mark extended minima's, extended maxima's along with morphological reconstruction operations on an image for delineation and tree crown segmentation. To separate two touching crowns, a marker controlled watershed algorithm is used. For second approach, the color segmentation method for tree identification is used. Starting with the conversion of an RGB image to HSV color space then filtering, enhancing and thresholding to isolate trees from non-trees elements followed by watershed algorithm to separate touching tree crowns. Third approach involves deep learning method for classification of tree and non-tree, using approximately 2268 positive and 1172 negative samples each. Each segment of an image is then classified and sliding window algorithm is used to locate each tree crown. Experimentation shows that the first approach is well suited for classification of trees is dense vegetation, whereas the second approach is more suitable for detecting trees in sparse vegetation. Deep learning classification accuracy lies in between these two approaches and gave an accuracy of 92{\%} on validation data. The study shows that deep learning can be used as a quick and effective tool to ascertain the count of trees from airborne optical imagery.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we assess the potential of a U-net convolutional network, a recent deep learning algorithm, to identify and segment (1) natural forests and eucalyptus plantations, and (2) an indicator of forest disturbance, the tree species Cecropia hololeuca, in very high resolution images (0.3 m) from the WorldView-3 satellite in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest region. The networks for forest types and Cecropia trees were trained with 7611 and 1568 red-green-blue (RGB) images, respectively, and their dense labeled masks. Eighty per cent of the images were used for training and 20{\%} for validation. The U-net network segmented forest types with an overall accuracy {\textgreater}95{\%} and an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.96. For C. hololeuca, the overall accuracy was 97{\%} and the IoU was 0.86. The predictions were produced over a 1600 km 2 region using WorldView-3 RGB bands pan-sharpened at 0.3 m. Natural and eucalyptus forests compose 79 and 21{\%} of the region's total forest cover (82 250 ha). Cecropia crowns covered 1{\%} of the natural forest canopy. An index to describe the level of disturbance of the natural forest fragments based on the spatial distribution of Cecropia trees was developed. Our work demonstrates how a deep learning algorithm can support applications such as vegetation, tree species distributions and disturbance mapping on a regional scale.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of deep learning for coniferous/deciduous classification of individual trees segmented from airborne LiDAR data. To enable processing by a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we designed two discrete representations using leaf-off and leaf-on LiDAR data: a digital surface model with four channels (DSM × 4) and a set of four 2D views (4 × 2D). A training dataset of tree crowns was generated via segmentation of tree crowns, followed by co-registration with field data. Potential mislabels due to GPS error or tree leaning were corrected using a statistical ensemble filtering procedure. Because the training data was heavily unbalanced ({\~{}}8{\%} conifers), we trained an ensemble of CNNs on random balanced sub-samples. Benchmarked against multiple traditional shallow learning methods using manually designed features, the CNNs improved accuracies up to 14{\%}. The 4 × 2D representation yielded similar classification accuracies to the DSM × 4 representation ({\~{}}82{\%} coniferous and {\~{}}90{\%} deciduous) while converging faster. Further experimentation showed that early/late fusion of the channels in the representations did not affect the accuracies in a significant way. The data augmentation that was used for the CNN training improved the classification accuracies, but more real training instances (especially coniferous) likely results in much stronger improvements. Leaf-off LiDAR data were the primary source of useful information, which is likely due to the perennial nature of coniferous foliage. LiDAR intensity values also proved to be useful, but normalization yielded no significant improvement. As we observed, large training data may compensate for the lack of a subset of important domain data. Lastly, the classification accuracies of overstory trees ({\~{}}90{\%}) were more balanced than those of understory trees ({\~{}}90{\%} deciduous and {\~{}}65{\%} coniferous), which is likely due to the incomplete capture of understory tree crowns via airborne LiDAR. In domains like remote sensing and biomedical imaging, where the data contain a large amount of information and are not friendly to human visual system, human-designed features may become suboptimal. As exemplified by this study, automatic, objective derivation of optimal features via deep learning can improve prediction tasks in such domains.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the distribution of tree species within a forest is key for multiple economic and ecological applications. This information is traditionally acquired through time-consuming and thereby expensive field work. Our study evaluates the suitability of a visible to near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.4 m for the classification of 13 tree species (8 broadleaf, 5 coniferous) on an individual tree crown level in the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve 'Wienerwald', a temperate Austrian forest. The study also assesses the automation potential for the delineation of tree crowns using a mean shift segmentation algorithm in order to permit model application over large areas. Object-based Random Forest classification was carried out on variables that were derived from 699 manually delineated as well as automatically segmented reference trees. The models were trained separately for two strata: small and/or conifer stands and high broadleaf forests. The two strata were delineated beforehand using CHM-based tree height and NDVI. The predictor variables encompassed spectral reflectance, vegetation indices, textural metrics and principal components. After feature selection, the overall classification accuracy (OA) of the classification based on manual delineations of the 13 tree species was 91.7{\%} (Cohen's kappa ($\kappa$) = 0.909). The highest user's and producer's accuracies were most frequently obtained forWeymouth pine and Scots Pine, while European ash was most often associated with the lowest accuracies. The classification that was based on mean shift segmentation yielded similarly good results (OA = 89.4{\%} $\kappa$ = 0.883). Based on the automatically segmented trees, the Random Forest models were also applied to the whole study site (1050 ha). The resulting tree map of the study area confirmed a high abundance of European beech (58{\%}) with smaller amounts of oak (6{\%}) and Scots pine (5{\%}). We conclude that highly accurate tree species classifications can be obtained from hyperspectral data covering the visible and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Our results also indicate a high automation potential of the method, as the results from the automatically segmented tree crowns were similar to those that were obtained for the manually delineated tree crowns.},

Based on the LiDAR point cloud, the approach collects crown information such as steepness and height on-the-fly to delineate crown boundaries, and most importantly, does not require a priori assumptions of crown shape and size. The approach segments trees iteratively starting from the tallest within a given area to the smallest until all trees have been segmented. To evaluate its performance, the approach was applied to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest, a deciduous closed-canopy forest with complex terrain and vegetation conditions. The approach identified 94{\%} of dominant and co-dominant trees with a false detection rate of 13{\%}. About 62{\%} of intermediate, overtopped, and dead trees were also detected with a false detection rate of 15{\%}. The overall segmentation accuracy was 77{\%}. Correlations of the segmentation scores of the proposed approach with local terrain and stand metrics was not significant, which is likely an indication of the robustness of the approach as results are not sensitive to the differences in terrain and stand structures.},

abstract = {Remote sensing can transform the speed, scale, and cost of biodiversity and forestry surveys. Data acquisition currently outpaces the ability to identify individual organisms in high resolution imagery. We outline an approach for identifying tree-crowns in RGB imagery while using a semi-supervised deep learning detection network. Individual crown delineation has been a long-standing challenge in remote sensing and available algorithms produce mixed results. We show that deep learning models can leverage existing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised delineation to generate trees that are used for training an initial RGB crown detection model. Despite limitations in the original unsupervised detection approach, this noisy training data may contain information from which the neural network can learn initial tree features. We then refine the initial model using a small number of higher-quality hand-annotated RGB images. We validate our proposed approach while using an open-canopy site in the National Ecological Observation Network. Our results show that a model using 434,551 self-generated trees with the addition of 2848 hand-annotated trees yields accurate predictions in natural landscapes. Using an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, the full model had an average tree crown recall of 0.69, with a precision of 0.61 for the visually-annotated data. The model had an average tree detection rate of 0.82 for the field collected stems. The addition of a small number of hand-annotated trees improved the performance over the initial self-supervised model. This semi-supervised deep learning approach demonstrates that remote sensing can overcome a lack of labeled training data by generating noisy data for initial training using unsupervised methods and retraining the resulting models with high quality labeled data.},

abstract = {Airborne lidar has been widely used for forest characterization to facilitate forest ecological and management studies. With the availability of increasingly higher point density, individual tree delineation (ITD) from airborne lidar point clouds has become a popular yet challenging topic, due to the complexity and diversity of forests. One important step of ITD is segmentation, for which various methodologies have been studied. Among them, a long proven image segmentation method, mean shift, has been applied directly onto 3D points, and has shown promising results. However, there are variations among those who implemented the algorithm in terms of the kernel shape, adaptiveness and weighting. This paper provides a detailed assessment of the mean shift algorithm for the segmentation of airborne lidar data, and the effect of crown top detection upon the validation of segmentation results. The results from three different datasets revealed that a crown-shaped kernel consistently generates better results (up to 7 percent) than other variants, whereas weighting and adaptiveness do not warrant improvements.},

abstract = {Mapping tropical tree species at landscape scales to provide information for ecologists and forest managers is a new challenge for the remote sensing community. For this purpose, detection and delineation of individual tree crowns (ITCs) is a prerequisite. Here, we present a new method of automatic tree crown delineation based only on very high resolution images from WorldView-2 satellite and apply it to a region of the Atlantic rain forest with highly heterogeneous tropical canopy cover – the Santa Genebra forest reserve in Brazil. The method works in successive steps that involve pre-processing, selection of forested pixels, enhancement of borders, detection of pixels in the crown borders, correction of shade in large trees and, finally, segmentation of the tree crowns. Principally, the method uses four techniques: rolling ball algorithm and mathematical morphological operations to enhance the crown borders and ease the extraction of tree crowns; bimodal distribution parameters estimations to identify the shaded pixels in the gaps, borders, and crowns; and focal statistics for the analysis of neighbouring pixels. Crown detection is validated by comparing the delineated ITCs with a sample of ITCs delineated manually by visual interpretation. In addition, to test if the spectra of individual species are conserved in the automatic delineated crowns, we compare the accuracy of species prediction with automatic and manual delineated crowns with known species. We find that our method permits detection of up to 80{\%} of ITCs. The seven species with over 10 crowns identified in the field were mapped with reasonable accuracy (30.5–96{\%}) given that only WorldView-2 bands and texture features were used. Similar classification accuracies were obtained using both automatic and manual delineation, thereby confirming that species' spectral responses are preserved in the automatic method and thus permitting the recognition of species at the landscape scale. Our method might support tropical forest applications, such as mapping species and canopy characteristics at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {Individual tree detection and counting are critical for the forest inventory management. In almost all of these methods that based on remote sensing data, the treetop detection is the most important and essential part. However, due to the diversities of the tree attributes, such as crown size and branch distribution, it is hard to find a universal treetop detector and most of the current detectors need to be carefully designed based on the heuristic or prior knowledge. Hence, to find an efficient and versatile detector, we apply deep neural network to extract and learn the high-level semantic treetop features. In contrast to using manually labelled training data, we innovatively train the network with the pseudo ones that come from the result of the conventional non-supervised treetop detectors which may be not robust in different scenarios. In this study, we use multi-view high-resolution satellite imagery derived DSM (Digital Surface Model) and multispectral orthophoto as data and apply the top-hat by reconstruction (THR) operation to find treetops as the pseudo labels. The FCN (fully convolutional network) is adopted as a pixel-level classification network to segment the input image into treetops and non-treetops pixels. Our experiments show that the FCN based treetop detector is able to achieve a detection accuracy of 99.7 {\%} at the prairie area and 66.3 {\%} at the complicated town area which shows better performance than THR in the various scenarios. This study demonstrates that without manual labels, the FCN treetop detector can be trained by the pseudo labels that generated using the non-supervised detector and achieve better and robust results in different scenarios.},

abstract = {Segmentation of real-world remote sensing images is challenging because of the large size of those data, particularly for very high resolution imagery. However, a lot of high-level remote sensing methods rely on segmentation at some point and are therefore difficult to assess at full image scale, for real remote sensing applications. In this paper, we define a new property called stability of segmentation algorithms and demonstrate that piece-or tile-wise computation of a stable segmentation algorithm can be achieved with identical results with respect to processing the whole image at once. We also derive a technique to empirically estimate the stability of a given segmentation algorithm and apply it to four different algorithms. Among those algorithms, the mean-shift algorithm is found to be quite unstable. We propose a modified version of this algorithm enforcing its stability and thus allowing for tile-wise computation with identical results. Finally, we present results of this method and discuss the various trends and applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Individual tree detection and crown delineation (ITDD) are critical in forest inventory management and remote sensing based forest surveys are largely carried out through satellite images. However, most of these surveys only use 2D spectral information which normally has not enough clues for ITDD. To fully explore the satellite images, we propose a ITDD method using the orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM) derived from the multi-view satellite data. Our algorithm utilizes the top-hat morphological operation to efficiently extract the local maxima from DSM as treetops, and then feed them to a modified superpixel segmentation that combines both 2D and 3D information for tree crown delineation. In subsequent steps, our method incorporates the biological characteristics of the crowns through plant allometric equation to falsify potential outliers. Experiments against manually marked tree plots on three representative regions have demonstrated promising results – the best overall detection accuracy can be 89{\%}.},

abstract = {Individual mangrove tree parameters are necessary for the efficient management and protection of this unique ecosystem, but to measure them using remote sensing (RS) is still a new and challenging task due to the high clumping density of mangrove crowns and the relatively low spatial resolution of RS data. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as an emerging RS technique, significantly improves the spatial resolution, but has not been used for individual mangrove analysis. This study presents the first investigation into the possibility of individual tree detection and delineation (ITDD) for mangroves using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data (91 pt./m 2 ) collected from UAV. Specifically, we aim to detect and measure tree height (TH) and crown diameter (CD) of each mangrove tree, and analyze the impact of crown clumping density and spatial resolution on mangrove ITDD. To this end, we combined the variable window filtering method and marker controlled watershed segmentation algorithm, and successfully delineated 46.0{\%} of the 126 field measured mangroves. This was promising considering the complexity of mangrove forest. TH and CD were estimated with higher accuracies than previous studies. The isolated trees, with the lowest clumping density, were delineated with the highest accuracy. To identify the optimal spatial resolution of canopy height model (CHM), we defined four spatial resolutions (0.1 m, 0.25 m, 0.5 m, and 1 m) and conducted a simulation. Based on the results, we propose a rule-of-thumb that the spatial resolution should be finer than one-fourth of CD for ITDD, which is also applicable to other forest types. The main difficulty for mangrove ITDD is an overall under-detection of trees, which is caused by the high clumping density and limited height difference between adjacent mangroves. We recommend combining UAV LiDAR with imagery and terrestrial LiDAR to improve the mangrove ITDD performance.},

abstract = {Airborne laser scanning data and corresponding field data were acquired from boreal forests in Norway and Sweden, coniferous and broadleaved forests in Germany and tropical pulpwood plantations in Brazil. Treetop positions were extracted using six different algorithms developed in Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden, and the accuracy of tree detection and height estimation was assessed. Furthermore, the weaknesses and strengths of the methods under different types of forest were analyzed. The results showed that forest structure strongly affected the performance of all algorithms. Particularly, the success of tree detection was found to be dependent on tree density and clustering. The differences in performance between methods were more pronounced for tree detection than for height estimation. The algorithms showed a slightly better performance in the conditions for which they were developed, while some could be adapted by different parameterization according to training with local data. The results of this study may help guiding the choice of method under different forest types and may be of great value for future refinement of the single-tree detection algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2012 Institute of Chartered Foresters.

abstract = {The study evaluates five existing segmentation algorithms to determine the method most suitable for individual tree detection across a species-diverse forest: raster-based region growing, local maxima centroidal Voronoi tessellation, point-cloud level region growing, marker controlled watershed and continuously adaptive mean shift. Each of the methods has been tested twice over one mixed and five single species plots: with their parameters set as constant and with the parameters calibrated for every plot. Overall, continuous adaptive mean shift performs best across all the plots with average F-score of 0.9 with fine-tuned parameters and 0.802 with parameters held at constant. Raster-based algorithms tend to achieve higher scores in coniferous plots, due to the clearly discernible tops, which significantly aid the detection of local maxima. Their performance is also highly dependent on the moving size window used to detect the local maxima, which ideally should be readjusted for every plot. Crown overlap, suppressed and leaning trees are the most likely sources of error for all the algorithms tested.},

abstract = {A comprehensive forest resource inventory needs more detailed species information at individual tree level. Although conventional ground-based measurement fails to achieve this target in an efficient way, the emergence of high resolution remote sensing images has made it possible in the past decade. Individual tree crown delineation is one of the most critical steps for tree species classification from remote sensing images. However, it is still challenging to delineate individual tree crowns in deciduous forests because of the continuous canopy. In this study, a multi-band watershed segmentation method is proposed to delineate deciduous tree crowns by constructing a spectral angle space. The proposed algorithm is further examined by a high resolution multispectral aerial image of a deciduous forested area in Haliburton Forest, Ontario, Canada. Results demonstrate that, the proposed multi-band watershed segmentation method outperforms the existing valley-following based ITC map, in terms of visual interpretation and quantitative evaluation.},

abstract = {Tree species classification accuracy at the individual tree crown (ITC) level depends on many factors, among which in this paper we analyzed: i) the remote sensing data used for the ITC delineation process carried out prior to the classification, and ii) the pixels considered inside each ITC during the classification process. These two factors were analyzed on the ITC level classification accuracy of boreal tree species (Pine, Spruce and Broadleaves), considering two remote sensing data types: hyperspectral and airborne laser scanning (ALS). ITCs were delineated automatically on ALS and on hyperspectral data. A manual ITC delineation was used as reference in the analysis. The pixel level classification was performed on the hyperspectral bands using a non-linear support vector machine. The classification at ITC level was obtained by applying a majority voting rule to the classified pixels confined by each ITC. The results showed that ITCs automatically delineated from hyperspectral data were usually smaller than those from ALS, and the tree detection rate for hyperspectral data was much lower compared to ALS data (28.4 versus 48.5{\%}). Regarding the classification results, using only manually delineated ITCs a kappa accuracy of 0.89 was obtained, while using only automatically delineated ITCs from hyperspectral or ALS data reduced the kappa values to 0.79 and 0.76, respectively. Slightly different results were achieved using semi-automatic approaches based on both manual and automatically delineated ITC (0.81 and 0.74, respectively). A selection of only certain pixels inside each ITC improved the classification accuracy from 1 to 7 percentage points. A selection based on the spectral values of the pixels was found more influential than the one based on the ALS-derived canopy height model. The best results were obtained after a selection based on the spectral values in the bands in the blue region of the spectrum using either the Otsu method or an ad-hoc percentile-based thresholding method. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This study provides a novel approach to individual tree crown delineation (ITCD) using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data in dense natural forests using two main steps: crown boundary refinement based on a proposed Fishing Net Dragging (FiND) method, and segment merging based on boundary classification. FiND starts with approximate tree crown boundaries derived using a traditional watershed method with Gaussian filtering and refines these boundaries using an algorithm that mimics how a fisherman drags a fishing net. Random forest machine learning is then used to classify boundary segments into two classes: boundaries between trees and boundaries between branches that belong to a single tree. Three groups of LiDAR-derived features-two from the pseudo waveform generated along with crown boundaries and one from a canopy height model (CHM)-were used in the classification. The proposed ITCD approach was tested using LiDAR data collected over a mountainous region in the Adirondack Park, NY, USA. Overall accuracy of boundary classification was 82.4{\%}. Features derived from the CHM were generally more important in the classification than the features extracted from the pseudo waveform. A comprehensive accuracy assessment scheme for ITCD was also introduced by considering both area of crown overlap and crown centroids. Accuracy assessment using this new scheme shows the proposed ITCD achieved 74{\%} and 78{\%} as overall accuracy, respectively, for deciduous and mixed forest.},

abstract = {Ensuring successful forest regeneration requires an effective monitoring program to collect information regarding the status of young crop trees and nearby competing vegetation. Current field-based assessment methodology provides the needed information, but is costly, and therefore assessment frequency is low. This often allows undesirable forest structures to develop that do not coincide with management objectives. Remote sensing techniques provide a potentially low-cost alternative to field-based assessment, but require the development of methods to easily and accurately extract the required information. Automated tree detection and delineation algorithms may be an effective means to accomplish this task. In this study, a tree detection-delineation algorithm designed specifically for high-resolution digital imagery of 6-year-old trees is presented and rigorously evaluated. The algorithm is based on the analysis of local transects extending outward from a potential tree apex. The crown boundary is estimated using the point of maximum rate of change in the transect data and a rule base is applied to ensure that the point is contextually suitable. This transect approach is implemented in both the tree-detection and crown-delineation phases. The tree-detection algorithm refines the results of an initial local maximum filter by providing an outline for each detected tree and retaining only one local maximum value within this outline. The crown-delineation algorithm is similar to the detection algorithm, but applies a different rule set in creating a more detailed crown outline. Results show that the algorithm's tree-detection accuracy was better than that using commonly applied fixed-window local maximum filters; it achieved a best result of 91{\%}. For the crown-delineation algorithm, measured diameters from delineated crowns were within 17.9{\%} of field measurements of diameter at the crown base on an individual tree basis and within 3{\%} when averaged for the study. Tests of image pixel spacings from 5 to 30 cm showed that tree-detection accuracy was stable except at the lowest (30-cm) resolution where errors were unacceptable. Delineated crown-diameter accuracy was more sensitive to image resolution, decreasing consistently and nonlinearly with increasing pixel spacing. These results highlight the need for very high resolution imagery in automated object-based analysis of forest regeneration. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

The number of oil palm trees in a plantation area is important information for predicting the yield of palm oil, monitoring the growing situation of palm trees and maximizing their productivity, etc. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework for oil palm tree detection and counting using high-resolution remote sensing images for Malaysia. Unlike previous palm tree detection studies, the trees in our study area are more crowded and their crowns often overlap. We use a number of manually interpreted samples to train and optimize the convolutional neural network (CNN), and predict labels for all the samples in an image dataset collected through the sliding window technique. Then, we merge the predicted palm coordinates corresponding to the same palm tree into one palm coordinate and obtain the final palm tree detection results. Based on our proposed method, more than 96{\%} of the oil palm trees in our study area can be detected correctly when compared with the manually interpreted ground truth, and this is higher than the accuracies of the other three tree detection methods used in this study.},

abstract = {Traditional single-tree detection methods usually need to set different thresholds and parameters manually according to different forest conditions. As a solution to the complicated detection process for non-professionals, this paper presents a single-tree detection method for high-resolution remote-sensing images based on a cascade neural network. In this method, we firstly calibrated the tree and non-tree samples in high-resolution remote-sensing images to train a classifier with the backpropagation (BP) neural network. Then, we analyzed the differences in the first-order statistic features, such as energy, entropy, mean, skewness, and kurtosis of the tree and non-tree samples. Finally, we used these features to correct the BP neural network model and build a cascade neural network classifier to detect a single tree. To verify the validity and practicability of the proposed method, six forestlands including two areas of oil palm in Thailand, and four areas of small seedlings, red maples, or longan trees in China were selected as test areas. The results from different methods, such as the region-growing method, template-matching method, BP neural network, and proposed cascade-neural-network method were compared considering these test areas. The experimental results show that the single-tree detection method based on the cascade neural network exhibited the highest root mean square of the matching rate (RMS{\_}Rmat = 90{\%}) and matching score (RMS{\_}M = 68) in all the considered test areas.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {Forest stand age plays a major role in regulating carbon fluxes in boreal and temperate ecosystems. Young boreal forests represent a relatively small but persistent source of carbon to the atmosphere over 30 years after disturbance, while temperate forests switch from a substantial source over the first 10 years to a notable sink until they reach maturity. Russian forests are the largest contiguous forest belt in the world that accounts for 17{\%} of the global forest cover; however, despite its critical role in controlling global carbon cycle, little is known about spatial patterns of young forest distribution across Russia as a whole, particularly before the year 2000. Here, we present a map of young (0–27 years of age) forests, where 12- to 27-year-old forests were modeled from the single-date 500 m satellite record and augmented with the 0- to 11-year-old forest map aggregated from the 30 m resolution contemporary record between 2001 and 2012. The map captures the distribution of forests with the overall accuracy exceeding 85{\%} within three largest bioclimatic vegetation zones (northern, middle, and southern taiga), although mapping accuracy for disturbed classes was generally low (the highest of 31{\%} for user's and producer's accuracy for the 12–27 age class and the maximum of 74{\%} for user's and 32{\%} for producer's accuracy for the 0–11 age class). The results show that 75.5 ± 17.6 Mha (roughly 9{\%}) of Russian forests were younger than 30 years of age at the end of 2012. The majority of these 47 ± 4.7 Mha (62{\%}) were distributed across the middle taiga bioclimatic zone. Based on the published estimates of net ecosystem production (NEP) and the produced map of young forests, this study estimates that young Russian forests represent a total sink of carbon at the rate of 1.26 Tg C yr−1.},
