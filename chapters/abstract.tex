Emerging remote sensing technologies and state-of-the-art deep learning methods demonstrated a big potential in forest inventory, transforming the scale, cost and speed of forestry assessments. This research presents a novel approach for Individual Tree Crown (\gls{ITC}) detection and delineation from RGB satellite images using the aerial imagery data for model training. Individual tree crown detection and delineation pipeline was built during this project, and the dataset, containing 0.31m and 0.5m RGB images and their segmentation maps was created from high-resolution aerial imagery. The hypothesis, stating that CNN model trained on rescaled aerial imagery is able to delineate the tree crowns directly from the satellite RGB imagery was confirmed. F1 score of 72\% and tree detection rate of 89\% was obtained from the satellite test image, which demonstrates promising perspective for the proposed approach to substitute the manual field assessments in forest inventory related tasks.
